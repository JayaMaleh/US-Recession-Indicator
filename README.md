# US Recession Predictor Indicator

Accurately predicting business cycle turning points, and in particular impending economic recessions, is of great importance to households, businesses, investors and policy makers alike. 
Prior research has documented that a variety of economic and financial variables contain predictive information about future recessions in the United States. Most prominently, Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) and Estrella and Mishkin (1998) have documented that the slope of the term structure of Treasury yields has strong predictive power for US output growth and US recessions at horizons up to eight quarters into the future. Other variables that have been considered as leading recession indicators include stock prices (Estrella and Mishkin (1998)), the index of Leading Economic Indicators (Stock and Watson (1989), Berge and Jord`a (2011)), credit market activity (Levanon, Manini, Ozyildirim, Schaitkin, and Tanchua (2011)), as well as various employment and interest rate measures (Ng (2014)).


## Yield Curve: 10-Year minus 3-mounth U.S. Treasury Rates

Many studies document the predictive power of the slope of the Treasury yield curve for forecasting recessions.That is, an “inversion” of the yield curve, in which short-maturity interest rates exceed long-maturity rates, is typically associated with a recession in the near future.  Why might these yield-curve slopes help predict recessions? Recall the interest rate on a long-term bond in part reflects the path of short-term interest rates expected over the life of the bond. In turn, this expected path is influenced by views about the business cycle and monetary policy. If market participants expect a downturn, they likely also anticipate that the FOMC will cut the future policy rate to provide monetary policy accommodation. The expectation of lower future rates reduces longer-term rates, and this could result in an inverted yield curve. A related explanation is that market participants might expect that aggressive monetary policy tightening by the FOMC, which would push up current rates relative to future ones, heightens the odds of a future decline in economic activity. To the degree the market’s forecast of a downturn is correct, such moves in the yield-curve slope will be associated with a higher probability of a future recession.

## U.S. UnemploymentRate vs Natural Rate of Unemployment

The profound impact of the Great Recession has prompted numerous studies by social scientists of its causes and consequences for individuals, their families, communities, and society more generally (see, for example, Grusky, Western, and Wimer 2011; Danziger 2013; Card and Mas 2016). This research has tracked economic outcomes such as the impacts of unemployment on poverty, economic inequality, and earnings growth, as well as social outcomes such as marriage and fertility, education, health, politics, and child development, throughout the recession and the immediate recovery. From these and other studies we have made important progress in understanding some of the consequences and mechanisms of the Great Recession. Yet many questions remain as to the nature and consequences of the Great Recession and its aftermath.

## Federal Funds Effective Rate

Changes in interest rates can have both positive and negative effects on the markets. Central banks often change their target interest rates in response to economic activity: raising rates when the economy is overly strong, and lowering rates when the economy is sluggish.

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) is responsible for setting the target interest rate at which banks borrow and lend money to one another (known as the federal funds rate), and this has a ripple effect across the entire economy. While it usually takes at least 12 months for a change in this interest rate to have a widespread economic impact, the stock market's response to a change is often more immediate.

## CBOE Volatility Index

The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time index that represents the market’s expectations for the relative strength of near-term price changes of the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Because it is derived from the prices of SPX index options with near-term expiration dates, it generates a 30-day forward projection of volatility, or how fast prices change, is often seen as a way to gauge market sentiment, and in particular the degree of fear among market participants.

## Sahm Rule Recession Indicator
The Sahm Rule identifies signals related to the start of a recession when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate (U3) rises by 0.50 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months.
