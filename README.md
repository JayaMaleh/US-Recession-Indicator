# US Recession Predictor Indicator

Accurately predicting business cycle turning points, and in particular impending economic recessions, is of great importance to households, businesses, investors and policy makers alike. 
Prior research has documented that a variety of economic and financial variables contain predictive information about future recessions in the United States. Most prominently, Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) and Estrella and Mishkin (1998) have documented that the slope of the term structure of Treasury yields has strong predictive power for US output growth and US recessions at horizons up to eight quarters into the future. Other variables that have been considered as leading recession indicators include stock prices (Estrella and Mishkin (1998)), the index of Leading Economic Indicators (Stock and Watson (1989), Berge and Jord`a (2011)), credit market activity (Levanon, Manini, Ozyildirim, Schaitkin, and Tanchua (2011)), as well as various employment and interest rate measures (Ng (2014)).


## Yield Curve: 10-Year minus 3-mounth U.S. Treasury Rates

Many studies document the predictive power of the slope of the Treasury yield curve for forecasting recessions.That is, an “inversion” of the yield curve, in which short-maturity interest rates exceed long-maturity rates, is typically associated with a recession in the near future.  Why might these yield-curve slopes help predict recessions? Recall the interest rate on a long-term bond in part reflects the path of short-term interest rates expected over the life of the bond. In turn, this expected path is influenced by views about the business cycle and monetary policy. If market participants expect a downturn, they likely also anticipate that the FOMC will cut the future policy rate to provide monetary policy accommodation. The expectation of lower future rates reduces longer-term rates, and this could result in an inverted yield curve. A related explanation is that market participants might expect that aggressive monetary policy tightening by the FOMC, which would push up current rates relative to future ones, heightens the odds of a future decline in economic activity. To the degree the market’s forecast of a downturn is correct, such moves in the yield-curve slope will be associated with a higher probability of a future recession.
